This week I have been working on the activity diagram, defining an abstracted
version of the way that our game will work. This does not include the less
abstracted details within the game, but a far more general representation of the
way the elements all tie in together.

On top of this we have also been working on some more assets for the game
including characters and keys. I have found using a free online editor called
Piskel to have been a great aid for creating pixel-style sprites and tiles for
this game.

I felt that this style of character would fit the game we are designing well,
with enough familiarity to the popular explorer and adventurer: Indiana Jones.

##Splitting up some code##
Some time was spent this week going into code management for the project. A
`main.py` file has been created, but instead of filling it up with functions and
classes, I decided to split those up into their own files, complete with
docstrings and comments explaining how they work. Then the main file simply
imports them and thus has access to all of their respective functions and
classes. This will make it much easier to read through the main file, identify
where errors are being created, and for another programmer to come and
read/understand.
