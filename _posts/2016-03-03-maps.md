Today I have been working on the map. I have added a few extra tiles, a bush, a
rock and water tiles. Unlike before, the objects in the game now spawn randomly
instead of in a pre-defined location. As well as this, the map is generated
randomly but not without a tiny bit of intelligence to make it slightly more
realistic. Originally I was generating the items by simply moving over each
tile, and attempting a probability based condition that was not likely, this
would determine whether to add an asset on that space. Instead, now it takes
into account the items around it, and creates a higher chance of spawning if
there are more of its own tiles around. This now creates lumps of rock,
pools/lakes and vegetation patches, instead of it all being totally randomly
spewed out.

#Those Funky Blue Lines?#

So I added the blue lines in, as more of a human aid, to help identify where the
objects are in the map, as sometimes they are reasonably hard to identify,
especially when the robot is going fast.
