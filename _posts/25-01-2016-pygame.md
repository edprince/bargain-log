##Pygame##
This week I have started implementing some stuff with Pygame, mainly as a trial
run to see how viable it seems for this project.

I have created a simple 2D tile-based map with simple textures to play around.
The map is using the following data format:

{% highlight python %}
map = [[1, 1, 1], [3, 1, 1], [3, 3, 3]]
{% endhighlight %}


So there are multiple lists within lists. Each sub list represents a row, and
the containing list represents the columns. The numbers represent the type of
tile, so for example in my work I had:

{% highlight python %}
GRASS = 1  
STONE = 2  
DIRT = 3  
WATER = 4  
SAND = 5  
etc.  
{% endhighlight %}

This meant each value in the map list corresponds to one of the tile types.

#Map Parser#
Originally, I had the same list set up for creating the maps, but values being
the tile types, but shortly found this was taking far too long to efficiently
work with, so I decided to create the maps in a text file, with different
characters representing the different tiles, and then wrote a parser in Python
that would read the file and build the map list accordingly.


{% highlight python %}
def parse_map(data):
    '''Parses map data into lists

    Takes characters and if matching tile types, builds a list within a list of
    entire map'''
    tilemap_tmp = []
    for line in data:
        if line == '#':
            tilemap_tmp.append(SAND)
        elif line == '~':
            tilemap_tmp.append(WATER)
        elif line == 'v':
            tilemap_tmp.append(SAND)
        elif line == '_':
            tilemap_tmp.append(GRASS)
        elif line == '"':
            tilemap_tmp.append(DIRT)
        elif line == '=':
            tilemap_tmp.append(WOOD)
        elif line == '/':
            tilemap.append(tilemap_tmp)
            print tilemap_tmp
            tilemap_tmp = []
{% endhighlight %}
