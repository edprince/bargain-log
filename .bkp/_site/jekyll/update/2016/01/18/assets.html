  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This week so far I have been working on creating some assets for the game. We
have settled on the archaeological dig idea for the project, so I am able to
start doing some asset designs. I have a very basic 32x32 tileset to make the
map, and am now building up other assets for the game. I have created a cactus
object, that is generated in multiple random locations on the map using the TREE
DENSITY variable, declared at the top of the main file. They can however only be
generated if the tile on which it is being debated is SAND. This means they
cannot spawn in water/stone etc.</p>

<p>I have also created a bone, and a coin asset, both of which should eventually be
able to be collected.</p>

<h2 id="sorting-algorithm">Sorting algorithm</h2>
<p>I have implemented a bubble sort algorithm in Python, ordering a list of numeric
values. Although this can be done using the <code>sorted()</code> function in Python, I
felt it was worth implementing anyway. A difference to our sorting algorithm, is
that they potentially won’t just be sorting a single list of values, but instead
will be ordering objects in a list based on their value property.</p>

<h2 id="class-design">Class design</h2>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Item</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">location</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">item_type</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">quantity</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">name</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">value</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">location</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">location</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">item_type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">item_type</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">quantity</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">quantity</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This class is defined such that all instances are given the attributes: name,
value, location, item type and quantity. All of which are pretty self
explanatory. Using this, I have also written a function that can order any list
of objects, providing they have a <code>value</code> attribute.</p>

<p><img src="https://workablehr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/account/logo/11901/large_Mascot-fullcolor-png.png" alt="Travis CI logo" /></p>

<p>This is where Travis CI comes in. Once I had written the function to sort a list
of objects, I could use that function to test with. Once I could assure that
this was working properly, I could use both the function in the main file, and
the function in the travis test to both sort the same list. If they return the
same result, then I know the other function is highly likely to be running
correctly. If however, somebody makes changes to the function and breaks it,
then the travis test file will raise an error, changing the project status on
Travis to ‘failing’, which will change the badge on the README on GitHub, as
well as alerting people on Gitter.</p>
